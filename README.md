# face-crop-sofware
This sofware is being written as an experiment. I haven't coded any serious personal projects, so I decided why not try to do one?

This software is designed to crop images. Not only to crop images, but to crop them for a specific purpose. If you're like me you've had to do a lot of cropping and you are frankly sick of cropping, and decided to make a solution to crop images for you. That's why I've built this solution. It's rough, messy, and could use a LOT of work, but hey, by doing this I'm practicing skills that I haven't put into practice in ages and also practicing new ones like learning how to interface with AI that can help you write software like ChatGPT.

In the odd chance that you find this software useful or helpful... great! 

If you have any feedback, or want to submit a PR for whatever reason go ahead!
